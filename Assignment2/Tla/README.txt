I found that the tortoise and the hare cycle detection algorithm to be interesting as it is a great way to determine whether the program can end or if it has potential for an endless loop. This will help to familiarize myself with TLA as well as display some of the loops that can show up during the abstraction of the helicopter's concurrent running that I will be explaining using TLA for my project.

http://www.siafoo.net/algorithm/10 is where I gathered the information about the algorithm.
