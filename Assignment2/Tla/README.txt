I have implemented a simplistic TLA version of a steering wheel in order to give myself some practice with TLA language. This will be the first step towards my final project, which will be about describing the concurrent usage of systems within a helicopter. Aircraft wheels typically have 5 different options to take; Left, Right, Neutral, Push, Pull with Push and Pull affecting the nose of the aircraft, pulling it up or pushing it down. This implementation Is simplistic as it follows the wheels as it moves, with neutral being the "resting" state of the algorithm. While the implementation has these as seperate options, often the case that a turn and a push/pull action are used simultaneously in a realworld application.
